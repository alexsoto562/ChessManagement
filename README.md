Chess Tournament Manager: Program Guide Welcome to the Chess Tournament Manager, a Python-based application developed to manage chess tournaments efficiently. This program facilitates the creation of tournaments, management of players, conducting matches, and viewing tournament rankings and reports.

Installation and Setup: To get started with this application, you will need Python installed on your machine. Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine from the provided repository URL. After cloning, navigate to the project directory. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies efficiently. Once you're in the project directory and your environment is ready.

Running the Program: Starting the application is straightforward. Simply execute python main.py from the root of the project directory. The program uses a command-line interface, guiding you through the process of managing tournaments, players, and matches with on-screen prompts.

Generating a Flake8 HTML Report: To ensure the code quality of this program, we use Flake8, a tool that checks for compliance with PEP 8 coding standards. If you wish to generate a Flake8 report, first ensure you have Flake8 and Flake8-html installed (pip install flake8 flake8-html). Then, run flake8 path/to/your/code --format=html --htmldir=flake-report to generate the report. The report can be accessed by opening the flake-report/index.html file in a web browser.

Additional Notes: It's important to ensure that file paths, especially in the ManageTournament class, are correctly set according to your directory structure. For any issues, refer to the Python and Flake8 documentation for more information.

This README guide is designed to help you navigate through the installation, setup, and usage of the Chess Tournament Manager. Your feedback and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
